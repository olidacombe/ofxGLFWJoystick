=== TODO ===

+ Float smoothing
+ Aggregate Functions
  + x - y, radius/argument
+ Reduce CPU (I think it's looping really hard when window not visible)

+ Counters (checkbox on/off)
+ Axis mods (e.g. L1-2 changes CC of Axes 0-1 and releasing while holding leaves latched)
  + provide a matrix for button which can be mods, activating mod receivers
